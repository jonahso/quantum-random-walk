# Quantum Random Walk 

## Random Walk 

[Random Walk on Different Graphs](https://github.com/jonahso/quantum-random-walk/blob/291eb017ccccf01ee2c24f5022f5be2504b6bd63/random_walk.ipynb)

This notebook explores how entanglement entropy evolves during quantum walks on various graph structures, including glued-tree graphs.
